<template name="character_docs">
At first,there are 2 basic classes, that are  hardlybound together to implement some features.
1. Char. - the main class
2. Parameters. - describes parameters

Char. options:
[
	1. name - describes name of character
		string
		base: none, input due construction
	2. appearance - describes appearance
		string (should be object)
		base: none, input due construction
	3. free_points - describes ammount of available character points
		number (or maybe a string, representing number in future)
		base: 0
	4. parameters - describes character parameters. More information later.
		Object
		exemplar of class Parameters., described later
	5. effects
	6. feats
	7. skills 
]

Parameters. options:
[
	1. [strength, dextrity, constitution, mind, charisma, atack, defence, total_hp, will, regeneration, stamina, visible_distance, atack_distance, ...] - all of them descrbes key-parameters
		Object
		keys:
			[
				1. type - describes type of parameter, not really helpful at this time
					string
					base:
					[
						[strength, dextrity, constitution, mind, charisma]: "base"
						[atack, defence, base_hp, will, regeneration, stamina]: "secondary"
						[visible_distance,atack_distance]: "helper" - this kind should not be available to buy
						additonal parameters: "modula" - There is a basic way, to create additional parameters, this would be explain later. 
					]
				2. base cost - describes a price in points to gain 1(basicaly first, and sometimes every upper) level in this parameter. 
					number
					base:
					[
						[strength, dextrity, constitution, mind, charisma]: 10
						[atack, defence, regeneration, perception]: 5
						[will, stamina]: 2
						base_hp: 3
						additonal parameters: 5 - There is a basic way, to create additional parameters, this would be explain later.
						for all parameters of type "helper" base_cost is set equal 2, but this is atavism
					]
				3. total_points_cost() - it is a method, that calculate total points, spent in that parameter. It somehow flows from base_value. Logic is (or could be) different
					method, returns number
					for parameters of type "helper" returns 0
				4. modificator - maybe some kind of bonus
					number
					base: 0
				5. bonus - another kind of bonus
					number
					base: 0
				6. base_value - the level of parameter gained with poits or another way. Play in total_points_cost().
					number
					base: 0
				7. value() - Method, that give the current value of parameter whith all bonuses and modificators. Could be somehow different for all parameters.
					method, returns number

Char. methods:
[
	1. toString() - returns string, that somehow describes character
		arguments: none
		returns string
	2. change_base_value(parameter,additional_value) - changes base value of parameter by some number. Does not touch bonuses and so on.
		arguments:
		[
			1. parameter - which parameter to change
				string
				should be from list of existing parameters
			2. additional_value - number to add.
				number
		]
	3. add_bonus(parameter,additional_value) - the same, but changes bonus
	4. add_modificator(parameter,additional_value) - about modificator
	5. add_modula_parameter(parameter_name) - add additional parameter to list of all this character parameters. New parameter  come with 
		type: "modula"
		base: 0
		base_cost: 5
		modificator: 0
		bonus: 0
		base_value: 0
		It has base .value() method, that summ bonus, modificator and base_value, and .total_points_cost() method, that returns all spend points by just counting simple progression depending on base_cost - price of every next level is previos price + first level price (5,10,15,30...), so 3rd lvl total is 30.
		arguments:
			parameter_name - represent the name of this parameter
			string
	6. remove_modula_parameter(parameter_name) - delete pointed parameter. Works only with modula parameters.
		arguments:
			parameter_name - what parameter to delete
			string
	7. add_body_part(part_name) - create new part of body (hand, tail, etc)
		arguments:
			part_name - represent kind of this body part
			string
	8. remove_body_part(part_name) - delete pointed body part.
		arguments:
			part_name - which body part to delete
			string
	9. damage_body_part_hp(part_name,value) - add damage to bodypart. It works with property "damage" and does not modify hp direct.
		arguments:
			[
				1. part_name - which bodypart to damage
					string
				2. value - value of damage
					number
			]
